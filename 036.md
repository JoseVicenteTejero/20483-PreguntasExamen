QUESTION 36

You are developing an application by using C#. The application will process several objects per second.
You need to create a performance counter to analyze the object processing.
Which three actions should you perform in sequence? (To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order.)



1.- Add the CounterCreationData objects to the collection by calling the Add() method of the collection.

2.- Create a  PerformanceCounterPermissionEntryCollection collection.

3.- Call the Create() method of the PerformanceCounterCategory class and pass the collection to the method.

4.- Get the CategoryName property of the PerformanceCounterPermissionEntry Class.

  5.- Create a  CounterCreationDataCollection collection. Then create the counters as CounterCreationData objects and set the necessary properties.

EXPLANATION

Correct Answer:   5+1+3

CounterCreationDataCollection counterDataCollection = new CounterCreationDataCollection(); // Box1
// Add the counter. Box 1

CounterCreationData averageCount64 = new CounterCreationData();
averageCount64.CounterType = PerformanceCounterType.AverageCount64;
averageCount64.CounterName = "AverageCounter64Sample";
counterDataCollection.Add(averageCount64);
// Add the base counter.
CounterCreationData averageCount64Base = new CounterCreationData();
averageCount64Base.CounterType = PerformanceCounterType.AverageBase;
averageCount64Base.CounterName = "AverageCounter64SampleBase";
counterDataCollection.Add(averageCount64Base); // Box 2
// Create the category. Box 3
PerformanceCounterCategory.Create("AverageCounter64SampleCategory",
"Demonstrates usage of the AverageCounter64 performance counter type.",
PerformanceCounterCategoryType.SingleInstance, counterDataCollection);
