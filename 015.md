QUESTION 15
You are developing an application by using C#.
The application includes an object that performs a long running process.
You need to ensure that the garbage collector does not release the object's resources until the process
completes.
Which garbage collector method should you use?
A. ReRegisterForFinalize()
B. SuppressFinalize()
C. Collect()
D. WaitForFullGCApproach()

Correct Answer: B

Explanation in the following link:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.gc.reregisterforfinalize?view=netcore-3.1





 SuppressFinalize()  --> Requests that the common language runtime not call the finalizer for the specified object.

This method sets a bit in the object header of `obj`, which the runtime checks when calling finalizers. A finalizer, which is represented by the [Object.Finalize](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.object.finalize?view=netcore-3.1) method, is used to release unmanaged resources before an object is garbage-collected. If `obj` does not have a finalizer or the GC has already signaled the finalizer thread to run the finalizer, the call to the [SuppressFinalize](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.gc.suppressfinalize?view=netcore-3.1) method has no effect.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.gc.suppressfinalize?view=netcore-3.1



The [ReRegisterForFinalize](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.gc.reregisterforfinalize?view=netcore-3.1) method adds the `obj` parameter to the list of objects that request finalization before the garbage collector frees the object. The `obj` parameter must be the caller of this method.
