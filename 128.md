QUESTION 128
You are developing a class named EmployeeRoster. The following code implements the EmployeeRoster class. (Line numbers are included for reference only.)



01 public class EmployeeRoster

02 {

03	private Dictionary<string, int> employees = new Dictionary<string, int>();

04	public void Add(string name, int salary)

05	{

06	 	employees.Add(name, salary);

07	}

08

09 }

You create the following unit test method to test the EmployeeRoster class implementation:

public void UnitTest1()

{

​	EmployeeRoster employeeRoster = new EmployeeRoster();

​	employeeRoster.Add("David Jones", 50000);

​	employeeRoster.Add("Phyllis Harris", 75000);

​	int expectedSalary = 75000;

​	int actualSalary = employeeRoster["Phyllis Harris"];

​	Assert.AreEqual(expectedSalary, actualSalary);

}

You need to ensure that the unit test will pass.
What should you do?

A.- Insert the following code segment at line 08:

​	public dictionary<String, int> Employees

​	{

​		get

​		{

​			return employees;

​		}

​	}

B.- Insert the following code segment at line 08:

​		public int this[string name]

​		{

​			get

​			{

​				return employees [name];

​			}

​		}

C.- Replace line 03 with the following code segment:

​	public dictionary<string, int> Employees = new Dictionary<string, int>();

D.- Insert the following code segment at line 08:

​	public int salary(string name)

​	{

​		return employees[name];

​	}

Correct Answer: B

EXPLANATION

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/indexers/using-indexers

Indexers are a syntactic convenience that enable you to create a [class](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/class), [struct](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/struct), or [interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/interface) that client applications can access as an array. The compiler will generate an `Item` property (or an alternatively named property if [IndexerNameAttribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.compilerservices.indexernameattribute) is present), and the appropriate accessor methods. Indexers are most frequently implemented in types whose primary purpose is to encapsulate an internal collection or array. For example, suppose you have a class `TempRecord` that represents the temperature in Fahrenheit as recorded at 10 different times during a 24-hour period. The class contains a `temps` array of type `float[]` to store the temperature values. By implementing an indexer in this class, clients can access the temperatures in a `TempRecord` instance as `float temp = tempRecord[4]` instead of as `float temp = tempRecord.temps[4]`. The indexer notation not only simplifies the syntax for client applications; it also makes the class, and its purpose more intuitive for other developers to understand.

To declare an indexer on a class or struct, use the [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/this) keyword, as the following example shows:

C#Copy

```csharp
// Indexer declaration
public int this[int index]
{
    // get and set accessors
}
```

## Remarks

The type of an indexer and the type of its parameters must be at least as accessible as the indexer itself. For more information about accessibility levels, see [Access Modifiers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/access-modifiers).

For more information about how to use indexers with an interface, see [Interface Indexers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/indexers/indexers-in-interfaces).

The signature of an indexer consists of the number and types of its formal parameters. It doesn't include the indexer type or the names of the formal parameters. If you declare more than one indexer in the same class, they must have different signatures.

An indexer value is not classified as a variable; therefore, you cannot pass an indexer value as a [ref](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/ref) or [out](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/out-parameter-modifier) parameter.

To provide the indexer with a name that other languages can use, use [System.Runtime.CompilerServices.IndexerNameAttribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.compilerservices.indexernameattribute), as the following example shows:

C#Copy

```csharp
// Indexer declaration
[System.Runtime.CompilerServices.IndexerName("TheItem")]
public int this[int index]
{
    // get and set accessors
}
```

This indexer will have the name `TheItem`, as it is overridden by the indexer name attribute. By default, the indexer name is `Item`.
