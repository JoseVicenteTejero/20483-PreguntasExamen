#### List<T> Class

Represents a strongly typed list of objects that can be accessed by index. Provides methods to search, sort, and manipulate lists.

Enumerable.Where<TSource> Method (IEnumerable<TSource>, Func<TSource, Boolean>)
Filters a sequence of values based on a predicate.
Example:
List<string> fruits =
new List<string> { "apple", "passionfruit", "banana", "mango",
"orange", "blueberry", "grape", "strawberry" };
IEnumerable<string> query = fruits.Where(fruit => fruit.Length < 6);

foreach (string fruit in query)
{C
onsole.WriteLine(fruit);
}/

This code produces the following output:
apple
mango
grape
