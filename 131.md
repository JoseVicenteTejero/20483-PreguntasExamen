QUESTION 131
You have a C# application named App1 that invokes a method in an external assembly named Assembly1.
Assembly1 is written in C++ and is natively compile by using a debug build.
When you debug App1, you do not see any debug information for Assembly1.
You need to ensure that when you debug App1, you see the debug information for Assembly1.
What should you do?

A. On the Debugging page of the configuration properties for the C++ project, set the Debugger Type to Native Only.

B. On the Debugging page of the configuration properties for the C++ project, set the Debugger Type to Mixed.

C. On the Debug page of the project properties for App1, click Enable native code debugging.

D. In the project properties for App1, set the working directory to the same directory as Assembly1.

Correct Answer: B

| **Debugger Type** | Specifies the type of debugger to be used: **Native Only**, **Managed Only**, **GPU Only**, **Mixed**, **Auto** (default), or **Script**.  - **Native Only** is for unmanaged C++ code.                                                                                                      - **Managed Only** is for code that runs under the common language runtime (managed code).                                                                                     - **Mixed** invokes debuggers for both managed and unmanaged code.                                                                       - **Auto** determines the debugger type based on compiler and EXE information.                                                                                                             - **Script** invokes a debugger for scripts.                                                                                                                               - **GPU Only** is for C++ AMP code that runs on a GPU device or on the DirectX reference rasterizer.                                                                            See [Debugging GPU Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/es-es/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2015/debugger/debugging-gpu-code?view=vs-2015). |
