QUESTION 224
You are testing an application. The application includes methods named CalculateInterest and LogLine. The CalculateInterest() method calculates loan interest. The LogLine() method sends diagnostic messages to a console window.
The following code implements the methods. (Line numbers are included for reference only.)

01 

02  private static decimal CalculateInterest(decimal loanAmount, int loanTerm, decimal loanRate)

03   {

04   decimal InterestAmount = loanAmount * loanRate * loanTerm;

05   

06   LogLine("Interest Amount : ",  interestAmount.ToString("c"));

07  

08  return interestAmount;

09   }

10

11  public static void LogLine(string message, string detail)

12   {

13    Console.WriteLine("Log: {0} = {1}", message.detail);

14   }

- You have the following requirements:

  - The CalculateInterest() method must run for all build configurations.
  - The LogLine() method must run only for debug builds.
    You need to ensure that the methods run correctly.
  - 
  - 

  

  What are two possible ways to achieve this goal? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

  NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

  A.- Insert the following code segment at line 01:

  ​	#region DEBUG

  ​     Insert the following code segment at line 10:

  ​	#endregion

  B.- Insert the following code segment at line 01:

  ​	[Conditional("DEBUG")]

  C.- Insert the following code segment at line 05:

  ​		#region DEBUG

  ​	  Insert the following code segment at line 07:

  ​		[Conditional("DEBUG")]

  D. Insert the following code segment at line 10:

  ​		[Conditional("DEBUG")]

  E.- Insert the following code segment at line 01:

  ​		#if  DEBUG

  ​	 Insert the following code segment at line 10:

  ​		#endif

  F.- Insert the following code segment at line 10:

  ​	 [Conditional("RELEASE")]

  G.- Insert the following code segment at line 05:

  ​		#if DEBUG

  ​		Insert the following code segment at line 07:

  ​		#endif

  

  Correct Answer: DG

  Explanation
  
  OPCION D: 
  
  Also, it's worth pointing out that you can use [Conditional("DEBUG")] attribute on methods that return void to
  have them only executed if a certain symbol is defined. The compiler would remove all calls to those methods if
the symbol is not defined:
  
  [Conditional("DEBUG")]
  void PrintLog() {
  Console.WriteLine("Debug info");
  }
  void Test() {
  PrintLog();
  }
  
  
  
  OPCION G:
  
   When the C# compiler encounters an #if directive, followed eventually by an #endif directive, it will compile
  the code between the directives only if the specified symbol is defined. Unlike C and C++, you cannot assign a
  numeric value to a symbol; the #if statement in C# is Boolean and only tests whether the symbol has been
  defined or not. For example,
  #define DEBUG
  #if DEBUG
  Console.WriteLine("Debug version");
  #endif
